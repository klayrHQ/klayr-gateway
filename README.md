# Klayr Gateway

Klayr Gateway is the replacement of the old Klayr Service, built using the [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) framework. It is designed to provide a more efficient and scalable way to interact with and explore the Klayr blockchain. The Gateway will serve as a key component of the Klayr ecosystem, offering enhanced performance and features over the previous explorer.

## Status

ðŸš§ Work in Progress ðŸš§

This project is currently under active development. We are working towards building a robust and feature-rich platform, and it is not yet advised to run it yourself. As we continue development, we will update this README with detailed instructions on how to install, use, and contribute to the Klayr Gateway once it is ready for wider use.

## What's next?

We are aiming to create a stable and fully functional gateway for the Klayr blockchain. Stay tuned for updates! Weâ€™ll provide more information and guidance here as we approach our release milestones.
